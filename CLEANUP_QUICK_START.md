**For**: Repository maintainers and contributors  
**Purpose**: Quick reference for the cleanup process  
**Full Details**: See [CURRENT_MERGE_PLAN.md](CURRENT_MERGE_PLAN.md)

## TL;DR - What's Happening?

We have **14 open PRs**, many with conflicts. This PR provides:
- ✅ Complete analysis of all PRs
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategy
- ✅ Step-by-step execution plan

**Goal**: Reduce to < 5 clean PRs while merging valuable work.

## The Problem (In 30 Seconds)

```
❌ 14 open PRs
❌ 10 PRs have merge conflicts
❌ 4 PRs are duplicates
❌ PRs built on top of other PRs (dependency chains)
❌ Module shadowing bug blocking MCP server
```

## The Solution (In 3 Steps)

### Step 1: Merge Critical PRs (Must Do First)
```
PR #49: Fix module shadowing bug ⚠️ CRITICAL
  └─> Rename mcp/ to panelin_mcp_server/
  └─> Why: Blocks MCP server from starting
  └─> Time: 2-3 hours

PR #54: Add v1 MCP contracts ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY  
  └─> Establish API contract baseline
  └─> Why: Foundation for tool integrations
  └─> Time: 2-3 hours
```

### Step 2: Close Duplicates (Easy Wins)
```
Close PRs: #37, #44, #73, #76
  └─> Why: Duplicate work or superseded
  └─> Time: 30 minutes
```

### Step 3: Evaluate Remaining (After Step 1)
```
Review PRs: #58, #68, #69, #70, #71, #74, #75
  └─> Why: May be obsolete after Step 1
  └─> Time: 4-8 hours total
```

## Key Decisions Needed

**Decision 1**: Approve merge order?
- [ ] Yes, merge #49 first (module shadowing)
- [ ] Yes, merge #54 second (v1 contracts)
- [ ] No, different order: ___________

**Decision 2**: Approve closing duplicates?
- [ ] Yes, close PR #37 (duplicate of #49)
- [ ] Yes, close PR #44 (duplicate of #49)
- [ ] Yes, close PR #76 (superseded by #77)
- [ ] Yes, close PR #73 (low priority docs)

**Decision 3**: Execution timing?
- [ ] Start immediately
- [ ] Start on: ___________
- [ ] Need more information

## Risk Level: LOW ✅

**Why safe:**
- ✅ Only documentation changes in this PR
- ✅ Backup and rollback procedures documented
- ✅ Testing checklists prepared
- ✅ No force-pushes planned
- ✅ Can stop at any time

**Potential issues:**
- ⚠️ Testing may reveal bugs (that's why we test!)
- ⚠️ PR authors may need to rebase their work
- ⚠️ Some work may be lost if PRs are obsolete

## Expected Timeline

```
Day 1:
  Morning:  Merge PR #49 (module shadowing)
  Afternoon: Test, verify, merge PR #54 (contracts)
  Evening:   Close duplicate PRs

Day 2:
  Morning:   Evaluate dependent PRs (#58, #68, #71)
  Afternoon: Rebase and merge valuable PRs
  Evening:   Review infrastructure PRs (#69, #74)

Result: 14 PRs → 3-5 clean PRs
```

A: We have backup tags and rollback procedures documented. We test after every merge.

**Q: Can we stop halfway?**

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: 1-2 days of active work, can be spread over a week if needed.

**Q: Will this break anything?**
